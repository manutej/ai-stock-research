# FinWiz Setup Verification

## âœ… Setup Complete!

Your FinWiz installation is complete and configured with **Option 2: Shell Aliases**.

## What Was Done

1. âœ… Installed FinWiz in virtual environment at `/Users/manu/ASCIIDocs/CC_MCP/ai-stock-research/venv`
2. âœ… Added FinWiz aliases to `~/.zshrc`
3. âœ… Verified all aliases are working

## How to Use

### In NEW Terminal Windows

Every time you open a **new terminal window**, FinWiz will be available automatically:

```bash
finwiz NVDA          # Quick quote
fwq GOOGL            # Quick quote (short)
fwn MSFT             # Get news
fww                  # Show watchlist
fwb                  # Morning brief
```

### In CURRENT Terminal

For your current terminal session, you **MUST** run this once:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

You should see:
```
âœ“ FinWiz aliases loaded
Available commands:
  finwiz NVDA       - Run finwiz from anywhere
  ...
```

Then all finwiz commands will work:

```bash
finwiz NVDA
fwq GOOGL
fww
```

## Test It Out

Try these commands in a **new terminal window**:

```bash
# Test 1: Simple quote
finwiz NVDA

# Test 2: Quick alias
fwq GOOGL

# Test 3: Watchlist
fww

# Test 4: Multiple quotes
finwiz -r NVDA MSFT GOOGL

# Test 5: Get news
fwn AAPL --limit 3
```

## Available Aliases

| Alias | Command | Description |

| `finwiz` | Full command | Run finwiz with any options |
| `fwq` | `finwiz` | Quick quote (same as finwiz) |

## Troubleshooting

### "command not found: finwiz" in existing terminal

**Solution:** Run `source ~/.zshrc` once in that terminal.

**Important:** You MUST see the success message:
```
âœ“ FinWiz aliases loaded
```

If you don't see this message, the aliases didn't load. Check the troubleshooting steps below.

### Still not working?

1. Open a **completely new terminal window**
2. Try: `finwiz NVDA`
3. If it works, you're all set!
4. If not, verify the aliases are loaded:
   ```bash
   type finwiz
   ```
   Should show: `finwiz is an alias for source ...`

### Need to reinstall?

```bash
cd /Users/manu/ASCIIDocs/CC_MCP/ai-stock-research
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```
